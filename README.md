# Speech Recognition (portfolio repository)
During first term of my Masters at University of Cambridge we were challange with a task of designing a Continous Speech recognition system on TIMIT dataset. We tested different acoustic model systems including GMM-HMM systems and hybrid configurations ANN-HMM systems, where different ANN state output classification networks were tested.
